- added the option to add an offset to the value distribution of MapDynamikExpr
- changed EnvelopeGate so that it creates a new Envelope instead of overwriting the old one
- fixed a bug in the core that caused EnvelopeContainer (and possibly other ContainerViews) to redraw (and recompute) their entire content every time the cursor was set to another position
- fixed a fatal bug in FoldByParameter 
- fixed a bug in ImportFrequencies that caused quince to crash when encountering frequencies below 20 Hz
- performance imporovement for ImportFrequencies
- fixed a bug in CreateGridSequence that caused quince to crash whenever CreateGridSequence was opened again after the user manually closed its UI
- fixed a bug in LilyPondExport (Tempo changes are done correctly now!)
- found a bug in ApplyPitchCurve. no fix yet. workaround: load sequences into GlissandoContainer before executing the function.	
- added a preserveTiming check box to TempoChange: If you want to keep events at the same time when played in another tempo, check this box. If you want to "transpose" the timing of a sequence, leave it unchecked.
